# How it's made
Community garden application makes use of the following softwares:

- `NFTStorage`for data storage on IPFS that generates a transation hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

- `Unlock Protocol` to allow users to pay for exclusive content this protocol was a big part of our use case.

-  `Solidity`  for the smart contract
-  `OpenZeppelin ERC721`  we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of the PetGram smart contract

-  `Ganache`  for local blockchain development
 -  `Polygon, Matic Network` the network I deployed the app
-  `React Js, Material-ui,  Web3` React Js for the frontend,  Material-ui and Web3 to connect to blockchain.
